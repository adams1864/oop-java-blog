    <h1>Mastering the Basics of Object-Oriented Programming in Java</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept in software development that allows for more organized, reusable, and scalable code. Whether you're building a small application or a large-scale enterprise system, understanding OOP principles is crucial. In this blog post, we'll explore the basics of OOP in Java, a widely-used programming language, and demonstrate how you can apply these concepts to write clean and efficient code.</p>

    <h2>What is Object-Oriented Programming?</h2>
    <p>Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). The four main principles of OOP are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. Encapsulation helps to hide the internal state of an object from the outside world, exposing only what is necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Inheritance allows a new class to inherit the properties and behavior of an existing class. This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between parent and child classes.</li>
        <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Polymorphism enables a single function to behave differently based on the context. In Java, this is often achieved through method overloading (same method name, different parameters) and method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass).</li>
        <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features. In Java, this can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example: Creating a Simple OOP Structure in Java</h2>
    <p>Let’s create a basic example to illustrate these concepts. Consider a scenario where we want to model a system for managing employees.</p>

    <pre><code>
// Encapsulation: Employee class with private fields and public methods
public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private String department;
    private double salary;

    public Employee(String name, String department, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.department = department;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    // Getters and setters
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getDepartment() {
        return department;
    }

    public void setDepartment(String department) {
        this.department = department;
    }

    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }

    public void setSalary(double salary) {
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    // Polymorphism: Method overloading
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Department: " + department);
    }

    public void displayInfo(boolean showSalary) {
        displayInfo();
        if (showSalary) {
            System.out.println("Salary: " + salary);
        }
    }
}
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Inheritance and Polymorphism in Action</h2>
    <p>Now, let's extend our Employee class to create a Manager class that inherits from it.</p>

    <pre><code>
// Inheritance: Manager class extending Employee class
public class Manager extends Employee {
    private int teamSize;

    public Manager(String name, String department, double salary, int teamSize) {
        super(name, department, salary);
        this.teamSize = teamSize;
    }

    // Method overriding
    @Override
    public void displayInfo() {
        super.displayInfo();
        System.out.println("Team Size: " + teamSize);
    }
}
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Object-Oriented Programming is a powerful tool in any developer’s toolkit. By mastering the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, you can write more efficient, maintainable, and scalable Java applications. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, practicing these concepts will significantly enhance your coding skills and prepare you for more complex projects.</p>
